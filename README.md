This document contains my answers to Adalab's Module 3 Evaluation for the Data Analytics Part-Time Bootcamp regarding Data Transformation.

Technologies used: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, scikit-learn).

Each phase is identified and followed by Python scripts, with the corresponding tables/graphs/text to answer a specific question.

There are also the initial CSV files and the final ones, after the cleaning process has been performed.

As an educational assignment, the purpose is to keep learning.

Thank you for your feedback!
